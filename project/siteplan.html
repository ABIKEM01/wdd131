        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Servver</strong> – This name represents the service booking
          application that connects people in Nigeria with reliable service
          workers for home, car, and personal services. I chose it because it is
          short, memorable, and directly tied to the app brand I am developing.

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>

          The purpose of the Servver website is to provide information about the
          mobile application, including its benefits, available service
          categories, and how users can book service providers. It also serves
          as a contact point for customer inquiries and support. The website
          will showcase the value of the app and help build trust with potential
          users.
